TDD for sure,

Maybe some ajax when we add new items via text input js true for tests, maybe poltergiest

Refactor initial specs. expect no Clearance sets is an easy extraction
Maybe refactor to be tighter on the new_batch inspection
Consider adding shoulda specs for models.




Build notes,

for clearance batches, need 2 btns, complete batch, add to batch the batch is already complete I think, add to reopens and adds.

could build an additional table for 'in process clearance batches' adding radio buttons to correspond to which batch is being added to.

Consider if batches should have a max size. If so consider also ajaxing a counter on dynamic add to show remaining room in batch


Consider refactor of clearence batch factory to something with meat.
